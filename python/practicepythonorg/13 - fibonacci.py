#Write a program that asks the user how many Fibonnaci numbers to generate and then generates them. 
#Take this opportunity to think about how you can use functions. 
#Make sure to ask the user to enter the number of numbers in the sequence to generate.
#(Hint: The Fibonnaci seqence is a sequence of numbers where the next number in the sequence is the sum of the previous two numbers in the sequence. 
#The sequence looks like this: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, â€¦)

#Function to generate fibonaacci numbers.

			fib.append(fib[i] + fib[i-1]) #Adds together the i'th index number + the last number in the list and appends it to a list.
			i += 1 #We add 1 so that the while loop works correctly and also so that we keep moving along the index of the list.
			
	return fib #Returns the list.
